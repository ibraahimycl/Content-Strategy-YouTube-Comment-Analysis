"I double-majored in Math and Computer Science. Yes, it was very hard, but I was young and naive and I just dug in and did it. If I was &quot;older and wiser&quot; I might not have had the courage to do it. Now I study physics and continue practicing math in my free time. I told a friend this once and she said, &quot;You really need a girlfriend!&quot; Thanks for helping in my continued mathematical journey.",2025-06-17T15:39:18Z,0,0

"Badly needed this, thank you so much! I failed my calculus for the 2nd time and I realized I never had enough foundation for it since I was a careless kind of student in high school. I tried to study the basics and I was impatient, thinking that 1 example was enough and skipped everything. I genuinely do hope it gets easier and that it&#39;s never too late for me. : ) Currently mastering pre-cal and calculus to prepare for my biggest enemy.",2025-06-16T17:29:56Z,0,0
"&quot;That&#39;s when you have the most energy&quot;.<br><br>No. No it is not. It might be when <b>you</b> have the most energy, but I can assure you that many of us are the exact opposite. I can&#39;t do shit first thing in the morning, right after rolling out of bed. My energy peaks in the evening and at night. lead up until bed-time. Which is frustrating because sometimes it&#39;s hard to fall asleep because my mind is buzzing and I&#39;m all wired thinking about &quot;stuff&quot;. But there&#39;s no question that my most effective time for studying / writing / coding / etc. is at night.",2025-06-16T17:26:56Z,0,0

What is x +2=5?   5 is a whold number. 2 is a whole number. 3 is a whole number. X is anything that equals 3.  Technically we can&#39;t count. There is no fractions. Answer is 3/5 is x.  Yep socialism confuse people sense the beginning of time. Put out untrue mathematics.,2025-06-16T08:00:37Z,0,0
"You have teacher using socialism. 15% of 80 is ?? Well 80 is a whole number. It infinity with 80 stamped on it. So the answer is 15% of infinity.  Now if they said what is 15% of 80/1. I can count by 1. If its 80/2 i can count by 2.  All the way up to 80. Then its 1/80, 2/80. Its turns into degrees. Morphs into real complex math. Math yet to be fully expored.

WOULD lobe to here your opinion on that psychology  premise. On &quot; just focas on your strengths &quot; not your weaknesses??    Any help ???  Exp=  if  were not understanding a certain math  ...that maybe math is really not our strength.  And just leave it alone and foccus on something else were strong in ???

"Dear mr, i&#39;m currently having a 9 to 5 job and i really want to study math to boost my career. I try to read math book and study every night and make it hobby. But i can not keep the discipline for more than a week and just keep coming back to playing video game. Do you have any recommendations for quitting game, distracting stuffs and replacing them with math and studying ? Thank you.",2025-06-16T04:25:44Z,7,2
"Reply: You need to practice discipline. Any time you are tempted to do something besides what you are supposed to be doing, you are practicing discipline and having control of your own mind and that is a good thing. The more you do it, the easier it gets, though you will always be tested, and that will never stop.<br><br>Once you master discipline and controlling your mind to a certain degree it is very empowering!",2025-06-16T05:54:57Z,1,0
