I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ll see this. I have had a lifelong fear of math that has cropped my options and severely crippled my belief in myself and sense of self-efficacy. I am currently doing a course that requires some basic math - algebra and statistics - and the first semester has been so challenging that I have considered dropping out and losing the money I grinded for due to just this one math module. I don&#39;t believe I can do it. But I want to. Thanks for the reminder. Cheer me on friends. I&#39;ll comment here again when I graduate with my certificate.,2025-06-16T16:54:42Z,0,0
"Hello I&#39;m getting closer to study algebra again after months of hardwork, learning fundamentals and other things. I kept fighting and now I feel like I can do some of the things that I was afraid before. Thank you sir for inspiring us to keep going and never give up! May God continue to bless you sir.",2025-06-16T13:46:08Z,2,0

"What if it is not just belief, but a self-awareness of one&#39;s abilities? 🤔 It seems to fit too: those who aware of they can do something, they do that more often then those who aware of their inability to do that thing. 🤷‍♂️ So it is not obvious: is it believing made them do as they are or is it just people knowing what they can and what they can&#39;t. 🤔",2025-06-15T14:22:31Z,0,2

Can you please make a video on how to become obsessed with math or anything?,2025-06-15T13:41:10Z,36,6

Reply: Form a daily habit of working on things related to you studying math if you do something everyday you will be obsessed with it. if you want to call it obsession but merely it is the anticipation your brain forms for doing the same thing everyday it’s like the habit of smoking that smokers build their brain is anticipating cigarettes just bc they’re used to smoking everyday,2025-06-15T14:21:58Z,3,0
"Reply: Set a goal for yourself , for example ask yourself ,how much do I want my basic salary to be? Which people earn that kind of salary?Then plan out in steps how to become the person who can earn that kind of salary. If you need to study but there are gaps in your learning, then start learning the things necessary to get that degree. Take it one day at a time and keep in mind your goal : a certain salaryscale that will allow you to do the things you like to do.This will motivate your daily study  efforts because your working to  become a person who has a higher value in the marketplace. Also don’t tell anyone what your doing.",2025-06-15T15:40:53Z,0,0
