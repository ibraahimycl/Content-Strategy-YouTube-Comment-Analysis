I feel sorry for animals which are kept in zoos but having said that some of the animals in the zoos have being rescued to protect them as they have being hurt for humans or other animals other wise they would die.,2025-05-15T06:06:11Z,0,0

"I quite like zoos. People come to zoos because they want to see animals such as lions, giraffes, rhinos, elephants, tigers, penguins, crocodiles, and many more, but zoos are like animal prisons. The animals are kept in an enclosure where there is very little room to explore. They can just get fed up and bored with being in the same place all the time. It does, however, keep them safe from poachers, and animals from an endangered species may need to be kept in zoos for the sake of the species&#39; survival. The big question is, are they better off being vulnerable to poaching, or being cooped up in a zoo?",2025-05-12T22:03:05Z,0,0

"I find very difficult to have an opinion about animals be kept in zoos because on the one hand I think it&#39;s the only way some children get to see wild<br>animals but on the other hand, I agree with Neil that it&#39;s sad and cruel. The arguments against and in favour are very convincing in their thinking, but I can&#39;t make up my mind. I love my freedom, and besides I suffer from claustrophobia, I don&#39;t want to imagine if I were to be kept somewhere for ever. Maybe I&#39;m alredy making a statement!

"Basically, I feel that animals should not be kept in zoos now. Population of animals is reduced compared to the 19th century. Before, it was a type of education in learning animals. Now, individuals have internet connection and TV channels that give more information about animals. Moreover, wealthy people can afford themselves to visit Africa and South America, where forests and jungle are home for animals.",2025-05-08T13:08:40Z,4,2

"I really have some vivid memories from visiting the zoo in the city where my grandma lives. I used to be extremely excited to see some massive animals that (to be honest) I had seen in different science books. It was such a huge opportunity for my little brother and me to detach from the chaotic urban area as well. Unfortunately, I have to say that this zoo has become much emptier these days, and the only things left are some bears and (probably) some aquariums filled with little fish. However, this place didn&#39;t used to be a huge one where there had been so many species like lions or even elephants, but maybe one where people usually hung out, considering that there is a gigantic park right before you enter the zoo. I haven&#39;t visited this zoo since 2019, but I still have a deep feeling that this place is not popular anymore, as most animals died from natural causes. Over time, my perspective on animals kept in zoos has changed dramatically. When I was a child, visiting a place like this was the only opportunity to see them in real life, but now I feel deeply disappointed by the way they are treated.",2025-05-08T10:10:13Z,30,1
