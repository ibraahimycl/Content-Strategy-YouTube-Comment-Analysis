"Excellent to learn more meanings of jab, I only knew injection. That&#39;s the beauty of this language, so many meanings of the same word. It would be great if this drug helps to reduce cancer risk. Unfortunately many people died of one form of cancer or another. Many thanks Georgie and Neil for the lesson.",2025-05-15T09:10:11Z,1,0
