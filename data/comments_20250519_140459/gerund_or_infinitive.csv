"Actually, I think it should be &#39;either&#39; at the end there, not &#39;both&#39;, shouldn&#39;t it? &#39;Some verbs are followed by either,&#39; as no verb is ever followed by both a gerund AND an infinitive at the same time. Tell me I&#39;m wrong...",2025-05-17T10:01:13Z,1,0

"I remember watching this movie for the first time back in 2020. (I have a memory of doing that) <br>I have a good memory, but sometimes I forget to do something. For example, last week I remembered to buy milk on my way home, when I was being late for my online meeting (Is it okay to say &quot;I have a good memory&quot; or it sounds a bit unnatural?)",2025-05-09T12:12:59Z,1,1

"Reply: Humans are confused.<br>They only follow evidence in chemistry, science, electronics, medicine, and other areas. As for religion, they follow any religion other than Islam. It&#39;s simple: if you bought a Korean device, any Korean device, would you use it before reading the user manual?!<br>Would you read the user manual for another device? No, that&#39;s illogical.<br>How can you not read your guide from your Creator, which is Islam, which God has preserved until the Day of Judgment, and preserved the primary source of Islamic knowledge, the Holy Quran?<br>Beware: I urge you to learn the true Islam. Just as the Jews and Christians were divided, there are differences within Islam, some close to the essence of Islam and others far from it.<br>While Islam has evidence, and this is one, Christianity and Judaism are full of contradictions and lack evidence, such as transmitted evidence, i.e., authentic hadiths.<br>(This science is unique to Muslims, and the West applies it to the letter in the sciences, attributing the science to the one who wrote it. We say that Newton arrived at this law, and that was arrived at by Coulomb and others.<br>(As for other sciences, there are many, such as the induction that Coulomb performed to prove the law of electricity.)<br>How can the books of the two religions be valid in the face of the Holy Quran? The Quran is preserved. Yes, preserved to the point that you cannot even utter a single word. Go to Syria yesterday, and you will find a thousand children who have memorized the Quran by heart, letter by letter?!<br>What do you think of the era of the Companions,<br>when faith was high,<br>and the tongues were pure Arabic,<br>and the Companions were jurists and scholars, extracting benefits and teaching them to those around them?<br>When it was transmitted by continuous transmission? Do you know the meaning of continuous transmission? Come on, I will explain. Continuous transmission means that the Quran is logical, or rather mathematical, 100%, like arriving at a conclusion or axioms. The whole is greater than the part. It is always true, on Earth, on Mars, and today. And tomorrow.<br>Your books are contradictory, distorted, and their chains of transmission have been severed.<br>There is something wrong!<br>Have you seen what the Christians and Jews do in the name of religion and backwardness? (This one licks a dog, and the other slaughters a child!!!) What do you want?<br>We can pay for it.<br>Wouldn&#39;t we?<br>What better investment is there in your knowledge? Isn&#39;t it in people? Isn&#39;t it in children?!<br>Did the Companions do anything but good to you?<br>In Islam, we even pay you zakat for those we hoped would convert to Islam.<br>It is forbidden for us to lie to you.<br>Research the lessons of the scholars. How do we teach our children every day, in our weakness, patience, benevolence, truthfulness, and the morals of Islam? We want goodness and guidance for you.<br>Whether we are strong or weak, understand. Our weakness originally stemmed from our distance from Islam.<br>Some Jews and Christians have only added fuel to the fire, and how have they achieved good? Don&#39;t they know how to count?<br>There is much more to be said. Write &quot;Trampling on a Call&quot; or &quot;The Basis of a Single Message.&quot;<br><br>And be patient.",2025-05-09T11:33:12Z,0,0
