"Reply: Damn dude. I know what you&#39;re talking about. I once gave up completely on all my dreams. I thought that let&#39;s just forget them. Strangely enough, by body reacted as well.

"im 19. In six days, I&#39;ll take the university entrance exam. I always avoided studying, and now I&#39;m suffering the consequences of the decisions I made. I wish I had been disciplined enough to study throughout the year. Now I&#39;ll waste a whole year for it again. I hope I&#39;ll learn my lesson this time.",2025-06-14T16:52:14Z,5,2
"Reply: you are only 19. Imagine a world where you have to enlist in the military or volunteer for 3 years after high school. Then have to &quot;waste&quot; another year after to try to make it to a university you like, Then actually study for 4 years. Best of luck for you in the exam but a year of studying to enter university isn&#39;t a waste.",2025-06-15T07:38:28Z,3,0

"Choices have consequences:  it happens to all of us.<br>Some windows of opportunity, once closed not only can&#39;t open again, but are walled-over.<br>I have a lot of decades of hills and valleys to look back on, but am grateful for where I am.<br>Regardless, there&#39;s no going back to change the &quot;woulda, coulda &amp; shouldas&quot;.<br><br>Marshalling the fortitude to transform, &quot;I always wanted to &lt;fill-in the blank&gt;.&quot; into &quot;I&#39;m &lt;fill-in the blank&gt;.&quot; is revolutionary at any age.",2025-06-14T16:33:53Z,9,1

"Hello sir, <br>I feel like sometimes you can not take time for yourself, just fews moments enjoying life and time in society alone or surrounded by people. Like you said that, mathematics are applicable everywhere  life is, goes on and along. Yes, life is happening always everywhere. We can live it, observe it, feel it , experience it in so many ways <br>But, there is no reason or need to observe it so deeply all the time. I mean, mathematics are vast and not just only focused on natural processes or intergrative physics, hard calculations. Sometimes, the minds needs to rest",2025-06-14T13:56:31Z,7,0
