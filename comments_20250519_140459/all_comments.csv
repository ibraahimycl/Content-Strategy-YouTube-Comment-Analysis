"Thanks! 😊Great vocabulary and topic! Nowadays there is a truck-load of false doctors and nutritionists who advocate that we need to fry only on coconut, olive or avocado oils. They claim that they are allegedly safer for our gut and health. But I’d get it with a pinch of salt and thought-provoking. I don’t think that’s worth of the hype for some reasons. Firstly, they change the taste of product that I fry except for olive oil. Secondly, these oils are exported from other countries to my country so they’re way more expensive than sunflower oil for example. These veggies are not typical for the terrain of my country. And finally, we can use high oleic sunflower oil for frying food. It has some benefits and much cheaper than expensive analogs.",2025-05-15T15:02:05Z,0,0,which_cooking_oil_is_the_best_6_minute_english

"Reply: Humans are confused.<br>They only follow evidence in chemistry, science, electronics, medicine, and other areas. As for religion, they follow any religion other than Islam. It&#39;s simple: if you bought a Korean device, any Korean device, would you use it before reading the user manual?!<br>Would you read the user manual for another device? No, that&#39;s illogical.<br>How can you not read your guide from your Creator, which is Islam, which God has preserved until the Day of Judgment, and preserved the primary source of Islamic knowledge, the Holy Quran?<br>Beware: I urge you to learn the true Islam. Just as the Jews and Christians were divided, there are differences within Islam, some close to the essence of Islam and others far from it.<br>While Islam has evidence, and this is one, Christianity and Judaism are full of contradictions and lack evidence, such as transmitted evidence, i.e., authentic hadiths.<br>(This science is unique to Muslims, and the West applies it to the letter in the sciences, attributing the science to the one who wrote it. We say that Newton arrived at this law, and that was arrived at by Coulomb and others.<br>(As for other sciences, there are many, such as the induction that Coulomb performed to prove the law of electricity.)<br>How can the books of the two religions be valid in the face of the Holy Quran? The Quran is preserved. Yes, preserved to the point that you cannot even utter a single word. Go to Syria yesterday, and you will find a thousand children who have memorized the Quran by heart, letter by letter?!<br>What do you think of the era of the Companions,<br>when faith was high,<br>and the tongues were pure Arabic,<br>and the Companions were jurists and scholars, extracting benefits and teaching them to those around them?<br>When it was transmitted by continuous transmission? Do you know the meaning of continuous transmission? Come on, I will explain. Continuous transmission means that the Quran is logical, or rather mathematical, 100%, like arriving at a conclusion or axioms. The whole is greater than the part. It is always true, on Earth, on Mars, and today. And tomorrow.<br>Your books are contradictory, distorted, and their chains of transmission have been severed.<br>There is something wrong!<br>Have you seen what the Christians and Jews do in the name of religion and backwardness? (This one licks a dog, and the other slaughters a child!!!) What do you want?<br>We can pay for it.<br>Wouldn&#39;t we?<br>What better investment is there in your knowledge? Isn&#39;t it in people? Isn&#39;t it in children?!<br>Did the Companions do anything but good to you?<br>In Islam, we even pay you zakat for those we hoped would convert to Islam.<br>It is forbidden for us to lie to you.<br>Research the lessons of the scholars. How do we teach our children every day, in our weakness, patience, benevolence, truthfulness, and the morals of Islam? We want goodness and guidance for you.<br>Whether we are strong or weak, understand. Our weakness originally stemmed from our distance from Islam.<br>Some Jews and Christians have only added fuel to the fire, and how have they achieved good? Don&#39;t they know how to count?<br>There is much more to be said. Write &quot;Trampling on a Call&quot; or &quot;The Basis of a Single Message.&quot;<br><br>And be patient.",2025-05-09T11:33:12Z,0,0,gerund_or_infinitive

"I quite like zoos. People come to zoos because they want to see animals such as lions, giraffes, rhinos, elephants, tigers, penguins, crocodiles, and many more, but zoos are like animal prisons. The animals are kept in an enclosure where there is very little room to explore. They can just get fed up and bored with being in the same place all the time. It does, however, keep them safe from poachers, and animals from an endangered species may need to be kept in zoos for the sake of the species&#39; survival. The big question is, are they better off being vulnerable to poaching, or being cooped up in a zoo?",2025-05-12T22:03:05Z,0,0,should_animals_be_kept_in_zoos_6_minute_english

"I really have some vivid memories from visiting the zoo in the city where my grandma lives. I used to be extremely excited to see some massive animals that (to be honest) I had seen in different science books. It was such a huge opportunity for my little brother and me to detach from the chaotic urban area as well. Unfortunately, I have to say that this zoo has become much emptier these days, and the only things left are some bears and (probably) some aquariums filled with little fish. However, this place didn&#39;t used to be a huge one where there had been so many species like lions or even elephants, but maybe one where people usually hung out, considering that there is a gigantic park right before you enter the zoo. I haven&#39;t visited this zoo since 2019, but I still have a deep feeling that this place is not popular anymore, as most animals died from natural causes. Over time, my perspective on animals kept in zoos has changed dramatically. When I was a child, visiting a place like this was the only opportunity to see them in real life, but now I feel deeply disappointed by the way they are treated.",2025-05-08T10:10:13Z,30,1,should_animals_be_kept_in_zoos_6_minute_english

"what&#39;s the verb from this noun ( aberration ) ? , and I&#39;ve found a lot of the nouns or adjectives in English that we can&#39;t derive the verbs from . Why ? How can we derive nouns, adjectives, and regular verbs through fixed rules (and is it possible to derive nouns and adjectives from irregular verbs, and are there rules for that) and how do we know that some nouns and adjectives are nouns and adjectives in themselves and verbs cannot be derived from them and vice versa in deriving nouns and adjectives from the root of verbs as well and is it possible to derive nouns and adjectives through the verb or the root of the verb or derive verbs from nouns and adjectives and are there nouns and adjectives that do not have verb sources and are only nouns and adjectives .
