"I never heard the expression &quot;pack a punch&quot;. Interesting ways of using English. The more expressions we learn the more kind of native we&#39;ll sound. Not being pretentious, but that&#39;s something that at my age, quite old, I still love to achieve some day. Many thanks BBC teachers for the lesson.",2025-05-08T14:24:06Z,2,0

Reply: &#39;The teacher explained a lesson to the students by showing a picture&#39; is the correct sentence. We can use &#39;by&#39; + gerund to explain how we do something eg &#39;I learnt English by practising every day&#39;.,2025-05-08T09:31:47Z,2,0

WOW it&#39;s really interesting to know that octopuses and fish work together but sometimes octopuses punish some fish when they slack off. That was caught on camera. Nice discovery.,2025-05-07T22:25:32Z,2,1
