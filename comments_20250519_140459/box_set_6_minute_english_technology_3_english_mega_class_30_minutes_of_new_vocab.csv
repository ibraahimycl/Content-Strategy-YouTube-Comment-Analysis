"I don&#39;t like robots taking away jobs from real people if that can be avoided.<br>I agree about our attention span being very short. At least that&#39;s my case.<br>It&#39;s amazing how technology is helping people in different ways as you <br>are explaning in this lesson. I recalled using mirrors to try making fire when I was a <br>young girl, long time ago! It was enticing playing with fire at that age.<br>I definitely stick to my passwords. I&#39;ve written them but I don&#39;t carry them with me.<br>Many thanks great BBC teachers for the very interesting lesson.",2025-05-06T08:04:30Z,1,0

"what&#39;s the verb from this noun ( aberration ) ? , and I&#39;ve found a lot of the nouns or adjectives in English that we can&#39;t derive the verbs from . Why ? How can we derive nouns, adjectives, and regular verbs through fixed rules (and is it possible to derive nouns and adjectives from irregular verbs, and are there rules for that) and how do we know that some nouns and adjectives are nouns and adjectives in themselves and verbs cannot be derived from them and vice versa in deriving nouns and adjectives from the root of verbs as well and is it possible to derive nouns and adjectives through the verb or the root of the verb or derive verbs from nouns and adjectives and are there nouns and adjectives that do not have verb sources and are only nouns and adjectives . These are very important and essential questions for me because I am studying English interestingly and every day, so I hope to answer all of these questions if you please",2025-05-05T04:04:43Z,2,0

"Reply: That&#39;s great to hear! Just a quick tip - don’t forget ‘to’ after ‘listening’, and use ‘every day’ (two words) as the adverb form. Your sentence would be better like this:<br>&quot;I like listening to 6 Minute English every day.&quot; 😊",2025-05-06T08:32:10Z,0,0
