"My kitchen has a load of oils rice, sesame, olive, MCT, flaxseed, even ghee.<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/-fgfY9DIGYjbhgHLzoDIDw""></a><br>Someone claim they’re beneficial, and media advocates for MCT and flaxseed as wonder products. But honestly, it gets confusing. What the heck is actually true? Are the claims real or just myth or hogwash? My parents are the connoisseurs, so I just knock myself out and use what are there in the kitchen.🛢",2025-05-17T17:07:00Z,1,0

"Thanks! 😊Great vocabulary and topic! Nowadays there is a truck-load of false doctors and nutritionists who advocate that we need to fry only on coconut, olive or avocado oils. They claim that they are allegedly safer for our gut and health. But I’d get it with a pinch of salt and thought-provoking. I don’t think that’s worth of the hype for some reasons. Firstly, they change the taste of product that I fry except for olive oil. Secondly, these oils are exported from other countries to my country so they’re way more expensive than sunflower oil for example. These veggies are not typical for the terrain of my country. And finally, we can use high oleic sunflower oil for frying food. It has some benefits and much cheaper than expensive analogs.",2025-05-15T15:02:05Z,0,0
"From what I understand, for frying there&#39;s really no good oil. Any fried food is not healthy. For drizzling in a salad, olive oil is somewhat good, but it&#39;s still 14 % saturated fat.",2025-05-15T14:23:32Z,0,0
