       "15  i did started my CCNP preperation, i did pass my CCNA exam only through your CCNA course, i wonder how much left of this course that is not covered, tbh i thought it was only 59 videos but when i saw that you uploaded this video, and then i looked up for the CCNP exam topic and i saw there are still alot of topics that are not covered yet. my question, is there a paid version of this CCNP course where we can have the full course ? or do i need to look up for other resources ?  thank you anyway Jeremy you are a legend   \n",
